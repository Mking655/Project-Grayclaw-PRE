LEVEL DESIGN GUIDE

Step 1: Importing Assets
- Navigate to Assets > Import New Asset in Unity and select your 3D models.
- Attach the master texture to your imported models in the Inspector window.
- Ensure "Generate Lightmap UVs" is checked under the model's Import Settings.
- Drag each model from the Project window into the Scene, add components (Colliders, AudioSource), set properties (static or dynamic), and convert to prefab by dragging it back into a Prefabs folder. Assign relevant tags (e.g., "Floor", "Ladder").

Step 2: Scene Setup
- Add a Canvas to your scene via GameObject > UI > Canvas for UI elements.
- Create an empty GameObject and add a Post-Processing Volume component for global visual effects. Set up volume profiles as needed.
- Ensure your scene has a Main Camera set for your desired player view. Add a "Player Camera" component to the main camera.
- Create a GameObject named "POV Manager" and attach a component that manages player POVs.
- Add a UI element for the map and attach a "Map" component/script for in-game mapping.
- Place "INFO_MINBOUND" and "INFO_MAXBOUND" objects to define the map size. Assign these to the Map component.
- Create a Map Info ScriptableObject and drag this into the Map component's field.

Step 3: Defining Rooms
- For each room, create an empty GameObject and add a "Room" script for room-specific settings.
- Add components like a Reverb Zone, a Box Collider, and a Volume component to the room GameObject.

Step 4: Create Structural Elements
- Drag and drop your prefab objects into the scene to construct the layout and structure of the room.

Step 5: Setup Systems
- Within the POV Manager's canvas, create objects representing system cores. Add a "System Core" component to each.
- Add objects serving as endpoints for each system. Assign a "Physical Endpoint" component and link them to their logical counterparts.
- Once you have placed you endpoints, assign them to the corresponding room component of the room your physical endpoint is placed in.
- In the System Core component, define possible vulnerabilities and associate them with fixing minigames.

Step 6: Lighting
- Place and configure lights throughout your scene. Choose between realtime, baked, or mixed lighting modes.
- Once all lights are placed and configured, bake your scene's lightmaps through Unity's Lighting window.

Step 7: AI Characters
